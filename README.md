# Home-Automation
Voice controlled home automation using Arduino and HC05 Bluetooth module

The 'Voice-Control-App.aia' file is the flow for an android app using MIT App Inventor to facilitate Speech to text conversion and transmission to Arduino 
via the HC05 bluetooth module.
The 'SMS-Control-App.aia' file is the flow for an android app using MIT App Inventor to facilitate SMS text extraction and transmission to Arduino via the HC05 bluetooth module.
The 'Node-Red Flow.json' file is the flow which can be imported into Node-Red to provide a real time status view of the lights and other appliances connected to the circuit.
The 'home_automation.ino' file is the Arduino code required for the connected circuit to perform its necessary function.
